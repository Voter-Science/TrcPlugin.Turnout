            Here is reporting based on who has voted so far. Each section pivots on a different column. 
        </p>

        <h4>Totals</h4>
        <div id="xtotal"></div>

        <h4>Pivot by 'Targeted' voted.</h4>
        <p>Targets are determined by your campaign and visible in the XTargetPri column. 
            These are the names that appear in bold in the main view. 
        </p>
        <div id="xtarget"></div>

        <h4>By Party Identification breakdown</h4>        
        <div id="xparty"></div>

        <h4>By Result of contact:</h4>
        <p>
            This lets you see how your canvassing operation is affecting voter turnout.
            In theory, voters that you talked to will have a higher turnout overall than non-contacts. 
        </p>
        <div id="xcontact"></div>

        <h4>By supporters</h4>
        <p>'Supporters' are individuals that specifically support your campaign. They may come from both parties. 
            Make sure all your supporters vote! <p>        
        <div id="xsupporter"></div>

        <p>Here is a list of specific individuals that <em>said they'd support you</em> but <em>haven't voted yet</em>.
        Make sure they vote!<p>
